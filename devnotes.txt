[Notes][https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/documenting/standards]

Added functionality
-----------------
* Interactive token-less authentication (by pressing the bridge's button).
* Config flow support (for token-less auth) [ADR-0010][https://github.com/home-assistant/architecture/blob/master/adr/0010-integration-configuration.md#decision]
* Allows remote, programatic locking and unlocking with optional Pin for either or both of them (as well as Lock n' go).
* Door sensor integration, can be used as any other sensor.
* Breaks support for software bridge, untested (deprecated Jan 31st 2021)

Feature improvements
-----------------
* Push (added HTTP endpoint for the Nuki API to connect to) [Nuki API endpoint][https://developer.nuki.io/page/nuki-bridge-http-api-1-12/4/#heading--callback] [requested in forum][https://community.home-assistant.io/t/nuki-use-callbacks-instead-of-unreliable-polling/229064]
* Upgrades dependency (pynuki) that solves an interactive 'token-less' authentication issue [Nuki API endpoint][https://developer.nuki.io/page/nuki-bridge-http-api-1-12/4/#heading--auth]
* Now passing the Silver ü•à ü•á integration standard.

# Silver ü•à #
This integration is able to cope when things go wrong. It will not print any exceptions nor will it fill the log with retry attempts.
    - [+] Connection/configuration is handled via a component.
    - [x] Set an appropriate SCAN_INTERVAL (if a polling integration)
    - [ ] Raise PlatformNotReady if unable to connect during platform setup (if appropriate)
    - [ ] Handles expiration of auth credentials. Refresh if possible or print correct error and fail setup. If based on a config entry, should trigger a new config entry flow to re-authorize.
    - [ ] Handles internet unavailable. Log a warning once when unavailable, log once when reconnected.
    - [ ] Handles device/service unavailable. Log a warning once when unavailable, log once when reconnected.
    - [ ] Set available property to False if appropriate (docs)
    - [ ] Entities have unique ID (if available) (docs)

# Gold ü•á #
This is a solid integration that is able to survive poor conditions and can be configured via the user interface.
    - [ ] Configurable via config entries.
        Don't allow configuring already configured device/service (example: no 2 entries for same hub)
        Tests for the config flow
        Discoverable (if available)
        Set unique ID in config flow (if available)
    - [ ] Enities have device info (if available) (docs)
    - [ ] Tests for fetching data from the integration and controlling it (docs)
    - [+] Has a code owner (docs)
    - [ ] Entities only subscribe to updates inside async_added_to_hass and unsubscribe inside async_will_remove_from_hass (docs)
    - [+] Entities have correct device classes where appropriate (docs)
    - [ ] Supports entities being disabled and leverages Entity.entity_registry_enabled_default to disable less popular entities (docs)
    - [ ] If the device/service API can remove entities, the integration should make sure to clean up the entity and device registry.

# Platinum üèÜ #
Best of the best. The integration is completely async, meaning it's super fast. Integrations that reach platinum level will require approval by the code owner for each PR.
    - [ ] Set appropriate PARALLEL_UPDATES constant
    - [+] Support config entry unloading (called when config entry is removed)
    - [+] Integration + dependency are async
    - [x] Uses aiohttp and allows passing in websession (if making HTTP requests)

Breaking change
---------------
No breaking changes.


Proposed change
---------------
This PR fixes the nuki component. Due to the fact that the nuki id didn't persist in the Lock/Opener object updates would fail after a while. Typically this occured after a failed aggressive update.
Please see the [HA issue](#36719) and/or [pynuki issue](https://github.com/pschmitt/pynuki/issues/56#issuecomment-663086560) for more _technical_ information.
